### Day 26: January 28, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with IEnumerables and regular class.  

**Thoughts**: Made me a tool sharpening list to which I add items I'm struggling with such as the IEnumerable<> Each morning I'll spend 20 minutes working on an item from the list.  This should allow me to get better at my deficiencies while still allowing me to finish my work.

### Day 27, January 29, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Looked at Scott Allens new pluralsight course on .NET core applications.  Studied razor pages and power BI.  Created an application in .NET core to test the items learned from the course.

**Thoughts**: Wonder if i'll give up security by using razor pages instead of MVC at work.  The Razor seems an easier framework to use.

### Day 28: January 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed C# Best Practices: Improving on the Basics on pluralsight. A copy of the code is listed on my repository.  I'll add the link to the links below.  Additionally, was able to finally figure out what i was doing wrong with the classes at work.  I fixed the proglem and I set up the beginning and ending date generators for last month, current month, and last week, current week, yesterday, and today.  Also created the constants for shift start times and end times.  Created the method that passes in the correct Metric class with the beg and end dates and retrieves the data from the database.  Tested this and it is working.

**Thoughts**: Can't believe I was stuck so long on passing information from one class into another.

### Day 63:

**Today's Progress**: Refactored legacy code. Broke out several methods from the old code to use the dry method.  Completed 2 more modules for the report I'm working on.

**Thoughts**: Starting to really feel like i'm making progress with the dry principle.  Still need to work more on enumerables.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 63 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1110646618036932609)

### Day 64:

**Today's Progress**: Completed all calculations for the new module to my legacy application. At least 90% of the refactoring is done.  On to CSS for the new module.

**Thoughts**: I'm not excited about messing with CSS again but I need the practice :) So bring it on!!

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 64 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1111005021162729472)

### Day 65:

**Today's Progress**: Finished the new report and refactoring for my legacy application.  Lots of CSS today as well making everything look nice.  Also worked with SQL and moved tables from my test server to the prod one.

**Thoughts**: CSS is hard at first when you haven't touched it in awhile but once you get back in the groove it's almost like you never knew it :) 

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 65 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1111393095512317952)

### Day 66:

### Day 67:

**Today's Progress**: Lost of activity today.  Still troubleshooting a database connection issue with my Machine Tooling DBset.  Set up the new Ecoat Damaged Tooling SQL Table, the model, view, controller, also the email and the interface.  Did a lot of work in c# and SQL today.

**Thoughts**: I still need to reinforce my work with Entity Framework.  Still taking way too long for me to get where I need to be on this.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 67 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1112811820803272704)

### Day 68:

**Today's Progress**: Refactored my viewmodel for the pressline.  Added confirmations pages for all 3 damaged tooling report types.  Added more code to the controllers of all three reports.

**Thoughts**: MVC is still aggravating at times.  I hate it when I have to take a break and work in legacy c#.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 68 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1113195543474319360)

### Day 69:

**Today's Progress**: Lots of C# .Net Core MVC today.  Lots of fixes and bugs to tackle.  I was able to get everything working today.  Testing tomorrow and hopefully a release of the new iteration.

**Thoughts**: Need to work more with IEnumerables and configuration in asp.net core.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 69 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1113549820076089344)

### Day 70:

**Today's Progress**: Worked on c# .Net Core 2.2 today finished up my Damaged Tooling Reporting Application.  Published to the live server.  Working on new authomated report using db2 and sql stored procs.  This should be an interesting new project.

**Thoughts**: Worked on configuration this morning, have a much better grasp still need to do some more with IEnumberables to really drive the principle home.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 70 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1113903969317740545)

### Day 71:

**Today's Progress**: C# asp.net work refactoring my indirect time application.  It seems I wasn't infomed that on saturdays and sundays sometimes they only work 6 hours instead of 8.  This causes big problems when you are dividing times worked betweene shifts. 

**Thoughts**: Sometimes the simplest way is the most effective way as I found out today.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 71 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1114346322906234881)

### Day 72:

**Today's Progress**: Working on my Responsive Web Design Certification again after quite a break.  Almost finished with the CSS portion.

**Thoughts**: CSS is going much smoother and I learned a few new tricks this evening.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 72 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1115076037220687873)

### Day 73:

**Today's Progress**: Set up new C# .NET Core MVC app to house several reports from SQL and DB2.  Also worked with IBM.EntityFramework never used that in one of my projects.  Wanted to see if i could get it working.

**Thoughts**: It's definately monday,  very slow and bad day.

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 73 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1115342921857781760)

### Day 74:

**Today's Progress**: Set up a new project added nuget packages.  Attempting to use the IBM.EntityFramework for Core and DB2.  Did a lot of work today with SQL and DB2 setting up the select statements for the data for the program.

**Thoughts**: I've decided that many iterations versus my old habit of perfection is much better for getting customer focused and happy customers.  Keeping it simple for now.  Get it running and iterate, iterate, and if you forget iterate.

**Link(s) to work**: [Tweet Day 74](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1115716645102575617)

### Day 75:

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some legacy code adding a few new menus and starting a new metrics section.  Additionally spent a lot of time this morning on SQL Queries.  Last night I was working on creating a web scraper to play around with pulling in game specs and then comparing to laptop specs on the fly.  We will see more to follow.

**Thoughts**: It's Hump Day! Nothing super exciting today but it was nice and steady paced.  

**Link(s) to work**: [Day 75 Tweet](https://twitter.com/Raarge/status/1116066038670548992)

### Day 76:

**Today's Progress**: Completed the queries needed for the code in the new reports mainframe section.  Worked with CSS and made it look much nicer.

**Thoughts**: CSS can still be tricky to get right.  I created me a new class test-css-container that only has a border in it.  This is to let me see the size of all my containers on the page.

### Day 77:

**Today's Progress**: C# ASP.NET all day also using SQL stored proceedures from a new database.  Had some issues early on but was able to sort this all out.  Looking forward to the weekend and hopefully some more work on my new project web scraping. 

**Thoughts**: Fridays are Sweet especially at quitting time!!!

### Day 78:

**Today's Progress**: Spend a good part of the day sorting out a stored procedure I didn't write.  Managed to figure it out enough to call the stored procedure from c# asp.net and get the data I needed.  Just need to finish calculations tomorrow.

**Thoughts**:  It's Monday, does anyone think really on monday?

### Day 79:

**Today's Progress**: Learned a bit today about manipulating dates better than before.  Lots of C# ASP.NET and SQL Stored procedures today.

**Thoughts**: I love it when i get everything together to have the sql server time out on me.  :(

### Day 82:

**Today's Progress**:  Reloaded VSCode to use with C# set everything back up and added the addon VSCode Git Graph.  This is a pretty good little application.  I've connected it to github and tried it out on a project just to see what it looks like.  So far I think it's pretty good.  Thanks to @jiggscodes on twitter for turning me on to this.

**Thoughts**: Easter weekend and all I've done is work on a paper for my Masters.  At least I have a half a day to relax before going back to work.
