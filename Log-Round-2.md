# 100 Days Of Code - Log Round 2 - Raarge - aka Darin Campbell

### Day 1

**Today's Progress**:  Finished the form I was working on in R1D100.  Today I was able to get the data from the web page to the database.

**Thoughts**: Here we go. New start!

### Day 2

**Today's Progress**:  Started the series Algorithms Illuminated by Tim Roughgarden.  Most of my work today was in SQL to set up some new tables for my next project.

**Thoughts**:  None today.  Nope not me no thoughts.

### Day 3

**Today's Progress**:  A lot of the same.  Setting up the sql tables and basics for the next report.  Again working in C# asp.net.  Basically more of the same as before.

### Day 4

**Today's Progress**:  Did some reading and working on new SQL tips and tricks in IBM DB2.  Seems the more I've gotten into using IBM Data Studios the more proficient I am at distinguishing Microsoft SQL and IBM DB2 SQL.

**Thoughts**:  Is it friday yet?

### Day 5

**Today's Progress**:  Lots of DB2 Sql queries and finding data for this new report.  Very tiring and frustrating day.  I'm glad I love my job.  Also small victory, I have data in the program getting passed around now.  All the SQL work paid off.

**Thoughts**:  I mislabeled another one.  :(

### Day 6

**Today's Progress**:  New report Iteration #1 ahs been released into the wild.  Waiting on feedback.  Working on gridviews a little more.  I've cleaned them up but been awhile since I created one so I'm going to work on them and some sharpening of my CSS skills.

**Thoughts**:  Why do i constantly forget what i'm doing :)

### Day 7

**Today's Progress**:  Reworking some errors in one of my older reports.  Trouble shooting some of the code I wrote during Round 1 of 100 days.  I found out it wasn't an error in my code it did what i told it to.  However, it is dependent on the automation software writing data from the previous day for me to read.  Since this software was turned off by accident, I was getting no data.  This resulted in my getting a divide by zero error on my web page.  This was poor coding on my part not to check for this.  I have recoded it to display an error in the columns but still create the page.  

**Thoughts**:  Sometimes I wonder what I was thinking when I look at my older code.

### Day 8

**Today's Progress**:  So decided to revisit the report mentioned on the previous day.  I have refactored the code upon pulling the data from the database to check for a value of 0.  I will add the logic to then requery the database looking at the last 5 days without a zero value ignoring saturday and sunday values and then average them to give me the expected racks per shift.  It will then pass this back to the calling method while sending myself and the automation engineer an email letting us know that the automation application is not running reporting the data.  I'll probably start coding this tomorrow.
